        <h1> Soccer as a hobby</h1>
        <p> Soccer is not just a hobby and a sport for me, it's also a way for me to "run away" from reality.
            It's a way for me to have fun, meet new people, and really be in the moment.
        </p>
        <p> Soccer arent just for the practice and staying active, it's also a good way for your brain to relax.
            It's always been something I've been good at, and that's very motivating for me.
